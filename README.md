# SoundWave
(IN-PROGRESS). Built with React, CSS & Django (Python), this web application allows users to easily download audio content from YouTube videos. The frontend offers a form for inputting multiple video URLs. Upon submission, the backend validates the URLs through Regular Expressions to ensure the links are from youtube, uses the Pytube library to download the audio content, and saves the resulting mp3 files on the user's device.
